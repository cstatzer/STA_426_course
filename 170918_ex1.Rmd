```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Sample data

Here, we sample 1000 points from the normal distribution

```{r sample}
x <- rnorm(1000)
```

## Generate Histogram

```{r histogram}
hist(x,200)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
